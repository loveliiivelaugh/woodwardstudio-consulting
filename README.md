# Michael Woodward Blog

Hi, I‚Äôm Michael, a software engineer by day and a curious writer by night. I work in tech, crafting intuitive user experiences. Here, I share my thoughts on design, engineering, AI, and the random sparks of inspiration that keep me going.

This blog is where I document my journey as a developer, thinker, and solo founder. You‚Äôll find deep dives into full-stack JavaScript development, the tools I build with (React, TypeScript, Vite, Bun, Supabase, etc.), thoughts on modern UI/UX design, and behind-the-scenes looks at the systems I automate to scale my work and creativity.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Topics I Write About

- Full-Stack Engineering (React, Bun, Supabase, Hono, Drizzle)
- Web UI/UX and Frontend Architecture
- Developer Automation and Productivity
- LLMs, AI, and Generative Tools
- Indie Dev and Business Building
- Content, Outreach, and Technical Writing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack (for this blog)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** MUI + Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Bun + Hono + Drizzle
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Markdown Rendering:** Custom MDX/Markdown pipeline
- **Workflow Automation:** n8n + OpenAI

## üìö What to Expect

Expect a mix of tutorials, opinion pieces, and experiments. I like shipping fast, learning publicly, and building tools that others can repurpose. Whether you're a fellow engineer or someone who just loves seeing how things work under the hood, there's something here for you.
